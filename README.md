# JavaBlog

A Java Web Application which is built on the MVC framework using Servlets, JSP and Derby as a database. 
A blog site, which creates a session once a User logs in, there is currently
only a Read to check for data stored in the database.
If time exists, I will update this application to make the blogs, CRUD.  

## Requirements

* IDE- (I used Netbeans.)
* Apache Tomcat Server
* JDK
* Derby Database(Comes pre installed with Netbeans)
